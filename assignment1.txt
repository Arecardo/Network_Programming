Implement a client-server Quiz game. The server will read quiz.txt file whenever a client gets connect with it. Each line in the file has question and answer separated by comma. The server will randomly order the questions and send them to the client one by one. The client will respond each question and if the response matches with the answer then it is correct. If the client answers three questions incorrectly, then the server will send a message to the client ‘Please come again after practice!’ and client will be terminated. If the client answers all the questions correctly with only two or less mistakes, then the server will send a message to the client that ‘Congratulations, you played very well!’ and the client will be terminated. Your server should be able to play with multiple client players at the same time. Please refer Python multithreading to achieve this.
